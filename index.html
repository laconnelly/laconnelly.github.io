                    About Cakes
                </h3>   
                <p> 
                    Hello everyone, the term "cake" has a long history. The word itself is of Viking origin, from the Old Norse word "kaka". 
                    Cakes may be classified according to the occasion for which they are intended. 
                    For example, wedding cakes, birthday cakes, cakes for first communion, Christmas cakes, Halloween cakes, and Passover plava (a type of sponge cake sometimes made with matzo meal)
                    are all identified primarily according to the celebration they are intended to accompany. The cutting of a wedding cake constitutes a social ceremony in some cultures. 
                    The Ancient Roman marriage ritual of confarreatio originated in the sharing of a cake.

                        I had Our Fun Bakery create my beautiful wedding cake and I must say I was completely satisfied! Not only was it beautiful but it was also delicious!

                        Jackie is the cookie monster! Over the past 5 years, Jackie and her amazing team, creation have always been the talk of every event that we have had from graduation parties, 
                        baby showers, to 21st and 50th birthdays.  Jackie can make anything:  She has crafted a T-bone steak and a whisk for different events. 
                        The only downfall was that while she was in the process of getting the bakery ready we were not able to order beautiful and delicious cookies for my husband’s 50th birthday.  
                        Everyone wanted to know where the cookies were.  Jackie is more than a baker, she is also an artist!
